.PP
Get the encryption checksum of a file given its inode's location on disk\&. This function retrieves the encryption checksum for a file's data blocks, so that it can be determined whether the encryption and decryption process was completed successfully\&. This is done by retrieving the inode and analyzing the contents based on the defined inode data structure\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIblock_num\fP The block location of the inode on disk\&.

\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
Returns a pointer to the checksum, which is a string\&. If the function returns NULL, then the function was unsuccessful\&.

.SS "int get_encrypted (uint32_tblock_num)"

.PP
Check if the specified file is encrypted given its inode's location on disk\&. This function checks whether a file's data blocks are encrypted by retrieving the inode and analyzing the contents based on the defined inode data structure\&. This allows for the file system to determine whether to decrypt the data blocks associated with the file before reading, or whether they are aren't encrypted and can be read normally\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIblock_num\fP The block location of the inode on disk\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
Returns whether the file is encrypted\&. If the returned value is 0 then the file is not encrypted and if it is 1 then the file is encrypted\&. Otherwise, the function was unsuccessful\&.

.PP
Get the index block which an inode links to given the inode's location on disk\&. This function retrieves the first index block location from an inode by retrieving the block and analyzing the contents based on the defined inode data structure\&. This allows the inode to be associated with its index block data structure, which in turn allows for the retrieval of all the data blocks associated with the file\&.
.PP

.SS "int get_index_entry (\fBinode\fPdirectory)"

.PP
Gets the next entry for the current directory and increments the index of the last accessed item within a directory\&. This function is used when reading directories\&. Directory elements are retrieved from an index data structure that corresponds with a directory's inode\&. Each of these elements must be iterated through in order to fully traverse a directory's contents\&. After the entire directory contents are traversed, the function returns a zero value\&. If the contents are traversed again, the function restarts from the beginning\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIdirectory\fP The inode of the current directory\&.

.PP
Get size of a file given its inode's location on disk\&. This function retrieves the file size attribute from an inode by retrieving the block and analyzing the contents based on the defined inode data structure\&. This allows for the file system to quickly retrieve the size of the data (in bytes) stored within a file's data blocks\&.

.SS "int link_inode_to_parent (uint32_tparent_location, uint32_tinode_location)"

.PP
Links the inode to a parent's index structure\&. This function works by accessing the specified parent inode, and accessing the index data structure that it links to within its defined inode data structure\&. After accessing this index structure, the specified child inode is appended to the index\&. The index is rebuilt and written to disk, and the newly created index is linked to within the parent's inode\&. This inode is then rewritten at the original location, overwriting the old one\&. Upon completion of this operation the old index blocks are freed\&. If a failure occurs during this operation, the changes are automatically undone\&. The internal implementation of this function utilizes copy-on-write journalling in order to prevent any damage to the file system from failed operations\&.

Resets the index entry count\&. Attempting to get the next directory item after this function has executed will get the first item in the directory\&. This function is used to reset the iterator for traversing the contents of a directory structure\&. After this function is called, any further attempts at traversing the contents of a directory will start over again from the first element\&.

.SS "int unlink_inode_from_parent (uint32_tparent_location, uint32_tinode_location)"

.PP
Unlinks a child's inode from the parent's index structure\&. This function works by accessing the specified parent inode, and accessing the index data structure that it links to within its defined inode data structure\&. After accessing this index structure, the block at each indexed location is loaded and the name attribute within the inode at that block is checked against the name within the specified child inode\&. Once a match is found, the corresponding indexed block is removed from the index structure\&. The index is rebuilt and written to disk, and the newly created index is linked to within the parent's inode\&. This inode is then rewritten at the original location, overwriting the old one\&. Upon completion of this operation the old index blocks are freed\&. If a failure occurs during this operation, the changes are automatically undone\&.
